I'm thrilled to announce that our paper "Discovering Latent Causal Graphs from Spatio-Temporal Data" has been accepted to ICML 2025 as an **oral presentation**! ðŸŽ‰

---

This work represents a significant step forward in understanding causal relationships within complex spatio-temporal datasets. Our approach addresses the challenging problem of causal inference when dealing with data that has both spatial and temporal dependencies.

#### Key contributions include:

<ul>
    <li>Novel methodology for latent causal graph discovery</li>
    <li>Robust handling of spatio-temporal dependencies</li>
    <li>Extensive empirical validation on real-world datasets</li>
    <li>Theoretical guarantees for identifiability</li>
</ul>

This research was conducted in collaboration with my amazing co-authors Sumanth Varambally, Duncan Watson-Parris, and my advisor Prof. Rose Yu at the Rose Spatio-Temporal Lab.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to present this work at one of the premier conferences in machine learning. Looking forward to the discussions and feedback from the community!
