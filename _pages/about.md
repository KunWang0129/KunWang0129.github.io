Hello there, Kun Wang/王堃 here.\
*Incoming CS PhD Student @ Princeton University | Mathematics & CS Undergrad @ UC San Diego*

Currently, I am a research assistant advised by [Prof. Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/) and [Prof. Yian Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/yianma/home) in the Rose Spatio-Temporal Lab. In the past, I have worked with [Prof. Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/) on 3D reasoning ability of Large Language Models. 

My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and scientific domains. I develop interpretable models through causality and generative AI, aiming to address challenges in climate science, healthcare, and dynamical systems.
