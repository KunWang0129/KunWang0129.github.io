I am Kun Wang (王堃), an incoming CS PhD student at Princeton University. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the Rose Spatio-Temporal Lab at UC San Diego under the supervision of Prof. Rose Yu.

My research interests focus on **cognition and AI processing**, **reasoning and problem-solving**, **statistical modeling of AI behavior**, and **human-AI interaction and creativity**. I am particularly interested in understanding how AI systems can be designed to better interact with humans and assist in creative processes.

I have been fortunate to work with several outstanding research advisors including Prof. Rose Yu, Prof. Yian Ma, and Prof. Manmohan Chandraker. Through these collaborations, I have developed expertise in spatio-temporal data analysis, causal inference, and AI-assisted content generation.

I am always open to discussing research collaborations and new opportunities in the intersection of AI and human cognition.
