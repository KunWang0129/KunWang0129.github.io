Hello there, Kun Wang here.\
*Incoming CS PhD Student @ Princeton University | Mathematics & CS Undergrad @ UC San Diego*

Currently, I am a research assistant advised by [Prof. Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/) and [Prof. Yian Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/yianma/home) in the Rose Spatio-Temporal Lab. In the past, I have worked with [Prof. Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/) on 3D reasoning ability of Large Language Models. 

My current research interest lies within the parallel of human and AI agents:
- ðŸ‘€ Cognition: How  humans and AI process complex environments with diverse sensory inputs.
- ðŸ§  Reasoning: Problem-solving from step-by-step analysis to parallel processing.
- ðŸ“Š Modeling: Modeling and guiding LLM behavior via statistical methods.
- ðŸ’¡ Creativity: The synergy of human insight and algorithmic processes.

<!-- Recently my interest has shifted towards probing the emergent abilitiesâ€”and limitationsâ€”of LLMs and AI agents, particularly in comparison to human cognition. -->
<!-- - **Out-of-Domain Challenges:** What underlying principles make tasks like spatial reasoning and multi-step puzzle solving uniquely challenging for LLMs despite human easeâ€”and how can we integrate their strengths in pattern recognition with human-inspired reasoning frameworks?*
- **Tool Understanding vs. Tool Use:** While LLMs demonstrate impressive tool-use capabilities (e.g., API calls, code interpreters), do they develop mechanistic understanding of these toolsâ€™ why and how, or merely master syntactic patterns? What gaps persist between operational competence and conceptual grasp? -->
